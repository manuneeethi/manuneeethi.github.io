Classical Era or the Golden age is called so because of the Imperial Guptas. A lot of important stuff happened during that time. This page consists some good works on the Guptas and the contemporary kingdoms. All kingdoms which were founded around 200-300 AD and lasted till 500-600 AD. It can also be said that these kingdoms are the ones between the ancient(<200 AD) and early medieval(~600AD to 1200/1300AD) kingdoms.

## 1. North Indian Kingdoms (North, North-West, North-East)

1. [The Guptas (320 AD to 550 AD)](/classical-era/the-guptas/)
2. [The Maukharis (~500 AD to ~600 AD)](/classical-era/the-maukharis/)
3. [The Kamarupas (350 AD to ~1150 AD)](/classical-era/the-kamarupas/)

## 2. Deccan, Central Indian Kingdoms

1. [The Vakatakas (250 AD to 500 AD)](/classical-era/the-vakatakas/)
2. [The Nagas of Padmavati (early 3rd Century AD to mid 4th Century AD)](/classical-era/the-nagas/)

## 3. Kannada lands

1. [The Kadambas (345 AD to 540 AD)](/classical-era/the-kadambas/)
2. [The Western Gangas (350 AD to 1000 AD)](/classical-era/the-western-gangas/)
3. [Early History of Tulu Nadu, The Alupas (200 AD+)](/classical-era/tulu-nadu/)

## 4. Telugu Lands

1. [The Ikshvakus of Andhradesha (early 3rd century AD to early 4th century AD)](/classical-era/the-ikshvakus/)
2. [The VishnuKundinas (~420AD to ~620AD)](/classical-era/the-vishnukundinas/)

Relevant sources:

- [History of the early dynasties of Andhra Desha](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.77294) by Bhavaraju Venkata Krishna Rao, 200 AD - 625 AD. It covers all the dynasties listed above for Andhra-Desha.
- [Early History of the Andhra Country](https://archive.org/details/EarlyHistoryOfTheAndhraCountry) by K. Gopalachari

## 5. Tamil Lands, Deep South

1. [The Pallavas (275 AD to around 900 AD)](/classical-era/the-pallavas/)
2. Deep South, The Kalabhras: From Krishna to Kaveri, the Kalabhras ruled from around 250 AD to 550 AD. Pallavas took over that region from Kalabhras. Pandyas were ruling the South of Kaveri contemporary to Kalabhras and they continued. But I need to fetch proper sources. Update necessary.

## 6. Kerala

It is said that the Cheras ruled Kerala till around 5th century AD. Post that, it was taken over by the Kalabhras. Once again, Cheras, Pandyas, Cholas reappear post 600/650 AD once Kalabhras' rule is over. I too am not clear what happened in this period. Update necessary.

## 7. Miscellaneous texts

Texts relevant to this era but has details about one or more of the above kingdoms.

1. [History of India, 150 AD to 350 AD](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfIndia150ADTo350AD) by K. P. Jayaswal
2. [Ancient India - History and Culture](https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.522928) by B. G. Gokhale
3. [The Story of Ancient India](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126899/) by B. G. Gokhale

Note:

1. Orissa is not covered because Kalinga region is conquered by the Imperial Guptas, so I don't think they'd have a separate history during this period.
2. I need some more reading on the Bengal region, about the Shashankas, will be update post that.
