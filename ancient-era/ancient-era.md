It starts with the Vedic period followed by the Mahajanapadas in the 600 BC to the Nandas, the Mauryas, the Shungas and many other dynasties(like the Kushanas, Western Kshatrapas etc.,) and goes on till a time period just before the rise of the Imperial Guptas. In Deep South, I believe it starts with the Sangam Age, covers the entire Sangam Age (is said to end at around 300 AD) post which the Kalabhras take over, it also covers the mighty Satavahanas until smaller kingdoms(like the Kadambas, Western Gangas) rise post its decline.

One note is for a few dynasties/kingdoms, I was unable to find exclusive books written on them, instead, there are a few books which talk a lot of different kingdoms in a given time period and therefore talk about the less-known ones too.

# 1. Northern Kingdoms and Dynasties

1. [The Mahajanapadas (6th century BC to 4th century BC)](/ancient-era/the-mahajanapadas/)
2. The Nandas: Good amount of content is covered in books on Ancient India by various authors (Checkout the "Miscellaneous Texts" section). Update necessary.
3. [The Mauryas (~320 BC to 185 BC)](/ancient-era/the-mauryas/)
4. [The Shungas (~187 BC to 73 BC)](/ancient-era/the-shungas/)
5. The Kanvas (73 BC to 28 BC): The books in the "Miscellaneous Texts" section discuss this dynasty. But not much content is present. Within a few decades of their ascendance, they were defeated by the Satavahanas. Update necessary.
6. [The Kushanas (30 AD to 375 AD)](/ancient-era/the-kushanas/)
7. TODO: Northern Kshatrapas, Western Kshatrapas, Indo-Scythians

# 2. Southern Kingdoms and Dynasties

1. [The Satavahanas (Late 2nd century BC to early 3rd century AD)](/ancient-era/the-satavahanas/)
2. [The Pandyas](/ancient-era/the-pandyas/)
3. [The Cholas](/ancient-era/the-cholas/)
4. [The Cheras](/ancient-era/the-cheras/)

Not many resources are available in English on Sangam Age Southern kingdoms (Pandyas, Cheras, Cholas). Will update with time.
