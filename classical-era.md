Classical Era or the Golden age is called so because of the Imperial Guptas. A lot of important stuff happened during that time. This page consists some good works on the Guptas and the contemporary kingdoms. All kingdoms which were founded around 200-300 AD and lasted till 500-600 AD. It can also be said that these kingdoms are the ones between the ancient(<200 AD) and early medieval(~600AD to 1200/1300AD) kingdoms.

## 12. Deep South, Kalabhras

From Krishna to Kaveri, the Kalabhras ruled from around 250 AD to 550 AD. Pallavas took over that region from Kalabhras. Pandyas were ruling the South of Kaveri contemporary to Kalabhras and they continued. But I need to fetch proper sources. Update necessary.

## 13. Kerala

It is said that the Cheras ruled Kerala till around 5th century AD. Post that, it was taken over by the Kalabhras. Once again, Cheras, Pandyas, Cholas reappear post 600/650 AD once Kalabhras' rule is over. I too am not clear what happened in this period. Update necessary.

# Miscellaneous texts

1. [History of India, 150 AD to 350 AD](https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfIndia150ADTo350AD) by K. P. Jayaswal

Note:

1. Orissa is not covered because Kalinga region is conquered by the Imperial Guptas, so I don't think they'd have a separate history during this period.
2. I need some more reading on the Bengal region, will be update post that.
