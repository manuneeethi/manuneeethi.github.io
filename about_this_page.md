Hi all!

I am Manu. I am an engineer by profession. I am mainly interested in political, military and economic history in general and that of India in particular. Primary intention is to curate/list interesting resources(books, videos, papers etc.,) on these topics. If time permits, I would like to write a few articles as well on the same.

Thanks for visiting my page!
