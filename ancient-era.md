title: Ancient Era (Until 200-300 AD)
permalink: /ancient-era/

It starts with the Vedic period followed by the Mahajanapadas in the 600 BC to the Nandas, the Mauryas, the Shungas and many other dynasties(like the Kushanas, Western Kshatrapas etc.,) and goes on till a time period just before the rise of the Imperial Guptas. In Deep South, I believe it starts with the Sangam Age, covers the entire Sangam Age (is said to end at around 300 AD) post which the Kalabhras take over, it also covers the mighty Satavahanas until smaller kingdoms(like the Kadambas, Western Gangas) rise post its decline.

One note is for a few dynasties/kingdoms, I was unable to find exclusive books written on them, instead, there are a few books which talk a lot of different kingdoms in a given time period and therefore talk about the less-known ones too.

# 1. Northern Kingdoms and Dynasties

## 1.1 Mahajanapadas (6th century BC to 4th century BC)

1. [Janapada State in Ancient India](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.119794) by Sudama Mishra

## 1.2 The Nandas

Good amount of content is covered in books on Ancient India by various authors (Check out the "Miscellaneous Texts" section).

## 1.5 The Kanvas (73 BC to 28 BC)

The books in the micsellaneous texts discuss this dynasty. But not much content is present. The Satavahanas brought them to and end and took over their kingdom. Update necessary.
